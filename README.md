# Processing all the way down - Teaching programming using Processing at a secondary level (Year 9 through 12)

## Project outline

* First step is to focus on year 9, 10 curriculum. Find areas that we can concentrate on and determine contexts that will be appealing for students to learn programming.
* Extend the methodology to subsequent years.

## Year 9, 10 curriculum items

* Investigate the role of hardware and software in managing, controlling and securing the movement of and access to data in networked digital systems (ACTDIK034)
	* We interpret this to teach the role of variables
* Investigate the role of hardware and software in managing, controlling and securing the movement of and access to data in networked digital systems (ACTDIK034)
	* generating a layout or report in a database or applying a style sheet to a web page
* Develop techniques for acquiring, storing and validating quantitative and qualitative data from a range of sources, considering privacy and security requirements (ACTDIP036)
	* We interpret this to teach the role of variables
* Analyse and visualise data to create information and address complex problems, and model processes, entities and their relationships using structured data (ACTDIP037)
	* We can do this through animation and game environments
* Define and decompose real-world problems precisely, taking into account functional and non-functional requirements and including interviewing stakeholders to identify needs (ACTDIP038)
	* Explanation through simulation
	* Specs-based development
* Design algorithms represented diagrammatically and in structured English and validate algorithms and programs through tracing and test cases (ACTDIP040)
	* DUH!!! 	   
* Implement modular programs, applying selected algorithms and data structures including using an object-oriented programming language
	* Concept of input->black box->output 
* Evaluate critically how student solutions and existing information systems and policies, take account of future risks and sustainability and provide opportunities for innovation and enterprise (ACTDIP042)
	* Resilience to change (scalability, maintainability)
