# Summary:

## Processing All The Way Down: Teaching Processing Stage 5 Secondary

**No coding knowledge was assumed.**

This group concentrated on producing a set of coding materials targeting Stage 5 (Year 9-10) suitable for the Australian National Curriculum (see README.md file in the workshop project link or the Australian Curriculum, F-10 Digital Technologies Curriculum [here](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/technologies/digital-technologies/?year=12987&strand=Digital+Technologies+Knowledge+and+Understanding&strand=Digital+Technologies+Processes+and+Production+Skills&capability=ignore&capability=Literacy&capability=Numeracy&capability=Information+and+Communication+Technology+%28ICT%29+Capability&capability=Critical+and+Creative+Thinking&capability=Personal+and+Social+Capability&capability=Ethical+Understanding&capability=Intercultural+Understanding&priority=ignore&priority=Aboriginal+and+Torres+Strait+Islander+Histories+and+Cultures&priority=Asia+and+Australia%E2%80%99s+Engagement+with+Asia&priority=Sustainability&elaborations=true&elaborations=false&scotterms=false&isFirstPageLoad=false)) from which the NSW Curriculum is derived. These materials can be adapeted for Primary students.

Content: This Project is in a single folder containing:

1. Automated materials to develop basic geometric inbuilt functions; point(), line(), rect(), ellipse(), vertex(), size() along with an introduction to colour utilising background();

2. A very basic game that students would collabaratively complete with both direct instruction and a inquiry-based cum problem solving approach that integrates the elements of the previous modules and introduces by way of analogy an initial concept of variables and non-nested conditionals.

Method:
Automation of individual student problem solving questions accompanied by immediate feedback solutions was attempted where possible. This was done in **Modules 1-8** where an student can be provided with Processing generated sample, task and solution png files.

The reason for this approach was to allow students to walk through the concepts and learn coding by experimenting and doing. 
The student examines a sample png screenshot. The task png screenshot has the parameters missing from the inbuilt functions featured in **Modules 1-8** parameters and these are to be filled in by the student to get the same ouptput on their display screen. This is similar to the cloze procedure, a teaching strategy frequently used in reading comprehension in which words are omitted from a passage and students are required to fill in the blanks.
